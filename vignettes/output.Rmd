Let's set up an example, using RAT's data emulator (used for code testing, not suitable for data simulations).

```{r}
# Simulate some data.
simdat <- sim_boot_data(clean=TRUE) 
# For convenience let's assign the contents of the list to separate variables
mycond_A <- simdat[[2]]   # Simulated bootstrapped data for one condition.
mycond_B <- simdat[[3]]   # Simulated bootstrapped data for other condition.
myannot <- simdat[[1]]    # Transcript and gene IDs for the above data.

# Call DTU
mydtu <- call_DTU(annot= myannot, verbose= FALSE,
                  boot_data_A= mycond_A, boot_data_B= mycond_B,
                  dprop_thresh=0.1, qboot=TRUE, rboot=FALSE)
```

# Output structure

The output of RATs is a list containing 4 elements:

```{r}
print( names(mydtu) )
```


## Parameters

`Parameters` is a list that contains information about the data and the settings for a particular run.

```{r}

## Genes

`Genes` is a [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/) listing 
results at the gene level. For your convenience, the respective aggregated transcript-level DTU calls are 
also included here (defined as at least one isoform being called DTU individually).

```{r}
# Genes table's fields.
print( names(mydtu$Genes) )
```

The first few columns show the result of each decision step in a boolean manner, allowing easy filtering of the table. 
The remaining columns list the values based on which these decisions were made.
Pseudo-code formulas are shown here to help understand how the different fields interact when making decisions.

## Transcripts

`Transcripts` is a [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/) listing 
results at the transcript level. For your convenience, the respective gene-level DTU calls are also included here.

```{r}
# Transcripts table's fields.
print( names(mydtu$Transcripts) )
```

The first few columns show the result of each decision step in a boolean manner, allowing easy filtering of the table. 
The remaining columns list the values based on which these decisions were made.
Pseudo-code formulas are shown here to help understand how the different fields interact when making decisions.

**Note:** The fields reporting on the bootstraps will not be shown when bootstrapping is disabled.


## Abundances
 
`Abundances` is a list of two `data.table`s, one for each condition. 
Each transcript is represented by a single abundance value per replicate, so if bootstrapped data was used, these values are the means across iterations. If plain abundances were provided as input, then `Abundances` essentially contains the input data. These abundances are included in the output because they are required for some of RATs' plotting options.

```{r}
# Elements of Abundances.
print( names(mydtu$Abundances) )
```

1. `condA` - (num) The transcript abundances in the first condition.
2. `condB` - (num) The transcript abundances in the second condition.

```{r}
# Abundance table for first condition.
print( head(mydtu$Abundances[[1]]) )
```

# Quick results

For your convenience, RATs provides a few functions to give you a quick summary of the run. They all follow the same style.

These reports should not be seen as a substitute for the detailed RATs output.

## Summary of DTU

The `dtu_summary()` function lists the total number of genes and transcripts for each of 3 categories:

* DTU:  There is significant change in isoform ratios (in terms of both effect size and statistical significance).
* non-DTU:  No significant change.
* ineligible: Ineligible for testing. Genes/transcripts with read count below the set threshold, or where the gene has only one known transcript.

```{r}
# A tally of the outcome.
print( dtu_summary(mydtu) )
```

The `get_dtu_ids()` function lists the coresponding identifiers per category.
The ID lists obtained ordered by effect size (`Dprop`).

```{r}
# Gene and transcript IDs corresponding to the tally above.
ids <- get_dtu_ids(mydtu)
print( names(ids) )
print( ids )
```

## Summary of isoform switching

Isoform switching is a subset of DTU. Primary isoform switching is often considered the most likely 
type of DTU to have an effect. The following two functions summarise the extent of isoform switching 
in the results:

```{r}
# A tally of genes switching isoform ranks.
print( dtu_switch_summary(mydtu) )

# The gene IDs displaying isoform switching.
ids <- get_switch_ids(mydtu)
print( names(ids) )
```

## Summary of DTU plurality

In case you want to know how many isoforms are affected per gene.

```{r}
# A tally of genes switching isoform ranks.
print( dtu_plurality_summary(mydtu) )

# The gene IDs displaying isoform switching.
ids <- get_plurality_ids(mydtu)
```

These give you the number and IDs of genes in which 2, 3, etc... isoforms show DTU.
