Set up an example.

```{r}
library(rats)

# Simulate some data.
simdat <- sim_sleuth_data(cnames = c("controls", "patients")) 
# For convenience let's assign the contents of the list to separate variables.
myslo <- simdat$slo
myannot <- simdat$annot

# Call DTU
mydtu <- call_DTU(annot = myannot, slo = myslo, name_A = "controls", name_B = "patients", 
                  varname= "condition", verbose= FALSE,
                  description="Comparison of two conditions using a simulated sleuth object 
                    for the purposes of the tutorial. Simulated using built-in functionality 
                    of RATs.")

# Quick results

For your convenience, RATs provides a couple of functions to give you a quick summary of your results.
However, we do recommend you become familiar with the actual results structure and content, so that you
can judge the quality of the DTU calls and trace the reasons behind the classification of each gene or transcript.

The `dtu_summary()` function lists the total number of genes and transcripts for each of 3 categories:

```{r}
# A really simple tally of the outcome.
print( dtu_summary(mydtu) )
```

* DTU:  There is significant change in isoform ratios.
* non-DTU:  No significant change.
* NA:  Not applicable. Genes/transcripts with abundance below the noise threshold, or where the gene has only one transcript.

Notice that **three types of results are given for genes**. That's because RATs uses *two* separate methods of identifying DTU:
The gene-level test works on the isoforms of each gene as a set, whereas the transcript-level test works on each isoform individually
and then aggregates the isoform results to form a gene-level result. Therefore, as of `v.0.4.2`, `dtu_summury()`
will display the DTU genes according to either method as well as the intersection of the two.


The `get_dtu_ids()` function lists the actual identifiers per category, instead of the numbers in each category.
As of `v0.4.2` it uses the same category names as `dtu_summury()` for consistency and clarity.

```{r}
# Gene and transcript IDs corresponding to the tally above.
ids <- get_dtu_ids(mydtu)

# Contents
print( ids )

# DTU positive genes according to the transcript-level test.
print( ids[[4]] )

```

The ID lists obtained with `get_dtu_ids()` are *ordered by effect size* (`Dprop`).

# Output structure

The output of RATs is a list containing 4 elements:

```{r}
print( names(mydtu) )
```


## Parameters

`Parameters` is a list that contains information about the data and the settings for a particular run.

```{r}
# Parameter list's elements.
print( names(mydtu$Parameters) )
```

**Note:** If bootstraps are disabled, the bootstrap-related fields may have `NA` values despite any values that were passed to their respective parameters.


## Genes

`Genes` is a [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/) with many fields, listing 
results at the gene level.

The G-test is used for gene-level calls. The G-test is designed to compare a set of counts against a set of ratios. To use it with two sets of
counts, we do the comparison both ways, using each condition in turn for each role. Thus, the table contains two sets of results,
marked with the `AB` and `BA` suffixes. It is possible to get a DTU-positive result here, even when all the individual transcripts
are predicted as DTU-negative, as the G test takes into account more information than the individual transcript proportion equality tests.

```{r}
# Genes table's fields.
print( names(mydtu$Genes) )
```

The first few columns show the result of each decision step. The remaining columns list the values based on which the decisions were made.

## Transcripts

`Transcripts` is a [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/) with many fields, listing 
results at the transcript level. For your convenience, the gene-level DTU calls are also included here.

The proportions test is used for the transcript-level calls. Changes can be attributed to specific transcripts,
but, as it uses less information, the test has a higher detection threshold and requires larger changes than the gene-level test.

```{r}
# Transcripts table's fields.

```

1. `target_id` - (str) Transcript identifier.

8. `rep_reprod` - (bool) Replication reproducible.
For positive DTU, `= (rep_dtu_freq >= Parameters$rep_reprod_thresh)`, for non-DTU `= (rep_dtu_freq <= 1 - Parameters$rep_reprod_thresh)`.

12. `stdevA` and `stdevB` - (num) The standard deviation of the abundance across the replicates.

30. `rep_dtu_freq` - (num) Fraction of replication iterations that support a positive `DTU` classification.

**Note** The fields reporting on the bootstraps will not be shown when bootstrapping is disabled.


## Abundances
 
`Abundances` is a list of two `data.table`s, one for each condition. Each transcript is represented by a single abundance value per replicate, 
so if bootstrapped data was used, these values are the means across iterations. If plain abundances were provided as input, then `Abundances` 
essentially contains the input data. These abundances are included in the output because they are required for some of RATs' plotting options.


```{r}
# Elements of ReplicateData
print( names(mydtu$Abundances) )
```

1. `condA` - (num) The transcript abundances in the first condition.
2. `condB` - (num) The transcript abundances in the second condition.

```{r}
# Abundance table for first condition.
print( head(mydtu$Abundances[[1]]) )
```
