# Relative Abundance of Transcripts

This is the Github repository for the Rats R package developed by
members of [The Barton Group] (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk) at [The 
University of Dundee] (http://www.dundee.ac.uk) to compute the relative usage of the
transcripts associated with a gene from the output of trnascript outing tools like [salmon](http://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/), [sailfish](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/software/sailfish/) and [kallisto](http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/). The idea here is to identify genes that show Differential Transcript Usage (DTU, as opposed to Differential Transcript Expression; DTE) within the transcritp abundance estimate data.

The aim is to make this a simple package available in [bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/).
