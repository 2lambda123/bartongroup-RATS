Set up an example.

```{r}
# Simulate some data.
simdat <- sim_sleuth_data(cnames = c("controls", "patients")) 
# For convenience let's assign the contents of the list to separate variables.
myslo <- simdat$slo
myannot <- simdat$annot

# Call DTU
mydtu <- call_DTU(annot= myannot, slo= myslo, name_A= "controls", 
                  name_B= "patients", varname= "condition", verbose= FALSE, 
                  dprop_thresh=0.1, qboot=TRUE, rboot=TRUE,
                  description="Comparison of two conditions using a simulated sleuth object for the purposes of the tutorial. Simulated using built-in functionality of RATs.")
```

We lowered `dprop_thresh` and bypassed the bootstrapping to increase the number of DTU positive 
classifications, to better illustrate the summary fucntions below for the given artificial data.

# Quick results

For your convenience, RATs provides a few functions to give you a quick summary of your results.
However, we do recommend you become familiar with the actual results structure and content, so that you
can judge the quality of the DTU calls and trace the reasons behind the classification of each gene or transcript.

## Summary of DTU

The `dtu_summary()` function lists the total number of genes and transcripts for each of 3 categories:

* DTU:  There is significant change in isoform ratios.
* non-DTU:  No significant change.
* NA:  Not applicable. Genes/transcripts with abundance below the noise threshold, or where the gene has only one transcript.

```{r}
# A really simple tally of the outcome.
print( dtu_summary(mydtu) )
```

RATs uses *two* separate methods of identifying DTU: The gene-level test works on the isoforms of each gene as a set, 
whereas the transcript-level test works on each isoform individually
and then aggregates the isoform results to form a gene-level result. Therefore, as of v0.4.2, `dtu_summury()`
will display the DTU genes according to either method as well as the intersection of the two.

The `get_dtu_ids()` function lists the actual identifiers per category, instead of the numbers in each category.
As of `v0.4.2` it uses the same category names as `dtu_summury()` for consistency and clarity.

```{r}
# Gene and transcript IDs corresponding to the tally above.
ids <- get_dtu_ids(mydtu)
print( ids )
```

The ID lists obtained with `get_dtu_ids()` are *ordered by effect size* (`Dprop`).


## Summary of isoform switching

Isoform switching is a subset of DTU. Primary isoform switching is often considered the most likely 
type of DTU to have an effect. The following two functions summarise the extent of isoform switching 
in the results:

```{r}
# A tally of genes switching isoform ranks.
print( dtu_switch_summary(mydtu) )

# The gene IDs displaying isoform switching.
ids <- get_switch_ids(mydtu)
print( ids )
```

Again, three versions of the results are shown, covering the respective DTU methods in RATs.
`MIX6` is demonstrating a switch in both primary and tertiary isoforms.

## Summary of DTU plurality

In case you want to know how many isoforms are affected per gene.

```{r}
# A tally of genes switching isoform ranks.
print( dtu_plurality_summary(mydtu) )

# The gene IDs displaying isoform switching.
ids <- get_plurality_ids(mydtu)
print( ids )
```

The categories are named by the number of isoforms affected. There is one gene (`MIX6`) that has `3` isoforms affected.

## Genes

`Genes` is a [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/) with many fields, listing 
results at the gene level.  For your convenience, the respective aggregated transcript-level DTU calls are 
also included here (defined as at least one isoform being called DTU individually).

The maximum likelihood-based G-test of independence is used to compare the set of isoform ratios between the two conditions. 

```{r}
# Genes table's fields.
print( names(mydtu$Genes) )
```

The first few columns show the result of each decision step. The remaining columns list the values based on which the decisions were made.
Pseudo-code formulas are shown to help understand how the different fields interact when making decisions.

**Note:** The fields reporting on the bootstraps will not be shown when bootstrapping is disabled.


## Abundances
 
`Abundances` is a list of two `data.table`s, one for each condition. Each transcript is represented by a single abundance value per replicate, 
so if bootstrapped data was used, these values are the means across iterations. If plain abundances were provided as input, then `Abundances` 
essentially contains the input data. These abundances are included in the output because they are required for some of RATs' plotting options.


```{r}
# Elements of ReplicateData
print( names(mydtu$Abundances) )
```

1. `condA` - (num) The transcript abundances in the first condition.
2. `condB` - (num) The transcript abundances in the second condition.

```{r}
# Abundance table for first condition.
print( head(mydtu$Abundances[[1]]) )
```
