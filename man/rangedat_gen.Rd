\title{Generate artificial read-count data for simulated 2-transcript genes, 
systematically covering a broad range of proportions, magnitudes and fold-changes.}
\usage{
rangedat_gen(propfrom = 0, propto = 1, propby = 0.05, magfrom = -5,
  magto = 5, magby = 1, foldfrom = -7, foldto = 7, foldby = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{propfrom, }{propto, propby: Range and step of proportions for 1st transcript. Sibling transcript complemented from these.}

\item{magfrom, }{magto, magby: Range of count magnitudes, in powers of 10.}

\item{foldfrom, }{foldto, foldby: Range of transcript ratio fold changes, in powers of 2.}
}
\value{
sleuth-like object. Contains \code{"kal"} ans \code{"bootstrap"} with the simulated data and the non-sleuth 
        \code{"rangesim"} with the simulation details.

minimal sleuth-like object. Includes list of tables with the simulation details for each transcript in each condition.
